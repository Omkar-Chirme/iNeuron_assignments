    "## Python Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * = mathematical operators\n",
    "\n",
    "  'hello'= String\n",
    "\n",
    "  -87.8 = Float\n",
    "\n",
    "  - = mathematical operators\n",
    "\n",
    "  / = mathematical operators\n",
    "  \n",
    "  6 = Interger\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What is the difference between string and variable?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable is container which holds any type of data, where as strig is a data type in which data is closed my single or double inverted cuammas '' or \"\". string is mutable and can be indexed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Describe three different data types.**\n",
    "\n",
    "String, integers, float.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions may contain integers and strings and mathematical operators. Epression can add, substract, multiply or divide and can also perform Logical operations like <,>,==,<=.=>,!=\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In an expression variable spam is equal to value 10. \n",
    "In a statement spam is declare as a variable having value as 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?**\n",
    "\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: Variable bacon contains integer 23. (bacon = 23)\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. What should the values of the following two terms be?**\n",
    "\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam' :- 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "'spam' * 3 :- 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In python Variable name can be started by letters or _ , but never by any intergers. Therefore variable name cannot be 100 or any name starting by integers\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?**\n",
    "\n",
    "int() for integer\n",
    "\n",
    "float() for float\n",
    "\n",
    "str() for string\n",

    "**10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?**\n",
    "**'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are trying to add an integer in a string that we cannot do. To fix this we must type 99 in closed inverted cuammas '99' to treat 99 as string. Therefore\n",
    "\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + '99' + ' burritos.'\n",
    "will give us desired output.\n",
